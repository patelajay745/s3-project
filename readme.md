# Terraform EC2 Instance with .war File from S3

This Terraform project automates the provisioning of an EC2 instance on AWS. The instance will be configured to automatically download a `.war` file from an S3 bucket during boot-up.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
==========================

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

You'll also need AWS IAM credentials configured on your system to authenticate with AWS.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd terraform-ec2-s3-war
   ```

3. Initialize the Terraform project:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. Customize the `variables.tf` file to suit your environment.

5. Apply the Terraform configuration:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

6. Confirm the changes and type `yes` when prompted.

7. Once the provisioning is complete, the EC2 instance will be created, and the specified `.war` file will be downloaded from S3 during instance boot-up.

## Configuration

- `variables.tf`: Contains the input variables for the Terraform configuration. Modify this file to customize the instance properties and S3 bucket details.

- `main.tf`: Defines the AWS resources to be provisioned, including the EC2 instance and associated configurations.

## Clean Up

To avoid incurring unnecessary costs, it's recommended to destroy the resources once they are no longer needed. You can do this by running:

```bash
terraform destroy
```
